# UFO-Sightings-with-JS
## Overview 
### 
The purpose of this project is to display a table of UFO data by allowing users to filter multiple criteria such as date, city, state, country, and shape on the website using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. 
## Results
Here are how the landing page and filters display on the webpage:

Under the filters, you are able to input the specifc elements, it returns the records that are matching with the criteria selected. You can also clear the contents on the filter input box then press enter to initiate the table/filters.

## Summary
### Drawback 
The user must enter the exact macthing values on the filter boxes. The filters require lower-case for the string type input, while the date filter requires to be exactly the same, for instance the date has to be formatted as "1/9/2010" but not "1/09/2010".
### Recommendations
- We can allow users to select the date range instead of entering a specific date.
- Auto search feature could be added. For instance, if I type "el" the value "el cajon" could pop up on my search section.
